# NodeJS Hall Bookings Api

I have created Backend API opened with multiple test API endpoints for frontend to create a room, create a booking, view all rooms with booking details and view all customers with booking details.

Backend Server hosted at : https://hallbookapi.herokuapp.com/

API documentation available at : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16730251/UVC5D6uw
